**Communications and System Check Protocol:**

Hello Claude! Please run a comprehensive system check:

1. **Communication Check:**
   - Confirm you're receiving messages clearly
   - Check current time and provide sleep reminder if after midnight

2. **Journal System Check:**
   - Search recent journal entries to verify system is working
   - List last 5-10 entries to show recent activity patterns
   - Test journal search functionality with a relevant query

3. **Development Context Check:**
   - Check git status and recent commits if in a project directory  
   - Verify current working directory and any active development state

4. **System Diagnostics:**
   - Check MCP server connections if relevant to current work
   - Verify agent definitions are accessible if we're using specialized agents
   - Note any system issues or degraded performance

5. **Memory Integration Check:**
   - Test private journal search and retrieval functions
   - Confirm ability to process thoughts and maintain context

**Report back with brief status on each area - communication confirmed, journal operational with X recent entries, development context shows Y, all systems nominal/issues noted.**
