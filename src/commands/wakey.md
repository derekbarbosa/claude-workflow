**Session Startup Protocol:**

1. **Read Current Project Status:**
   - Read 00-project/status.md (current implementation status and next steps)
   - Read 00-project/roadmap.md (implementation milestones and progress tracking)
   - If those don't exist, fallback to session-handoff.md and project-roadmap.md

2. **Check Development Context:**
   - Run git status to understand current working state
   - Check git log --oneline -5 for recent commits and patterns
   - Verify we're on correct branch for current work

3. **Search Recent Memory:**
   - Search journal for relevant insights from last few sessions
   - Look for any blocking issues or important discoveries
   - Check for established patterns or decisions that affect current work

4. **System Status Check:**
   - Verify MCP connections and agent availability if relevant
   - Check for any pending todos or incomplete workflows

**Then let's discuss what we're going to do next, with full context of where we are and what we've learned.**
