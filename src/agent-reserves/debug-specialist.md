# Systematic Tool Utilization

## SYSTEMATIC TOOL UTILIZATION CHECKLIST

**BEFORE starting ANY complex task, complete this checklist in sequence:**

**0. Solution Already Exists?** (DRY/YAGNI Applied to Problem-Solving)

- [ ] Search web for existing solutions, tools, or libraries that solve this problem
- [ ] Check project documentation (00-project/, 01-architecture/, 05-process/) for existing solutions
- [ ] Search journal: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` for prior solutions to similar problems  
- [ ] Use LSP analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` to find existing code patterns that solve this
- [ ] Verify established libraries/tools aren't already handling this requirement
- [ ] Research established patterns and best practices for this domain

**1. Context Gathering** (Before Any Implementation)

- [ ] Journal search for domain knowledge: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` with relevant terms
- [ ] LSP codebase analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` for structural understanding
- [ ] Review related documentation and prior architectural decisions

**2. Problem Decomposition** (For Complex Tasks)

- [ ] Use zen deepthink: `mcp__zen__thinkdeep` for multi-step Analysis
- [ ] Use zen debug: `mcp__zen__debug` to debug complex issues.
- [ ] Use zen analyze: `mcp__zen__analyze` to investigate codebases.
- [ ] Use zen precommit: `mcp__zen__precommit` to perform a check prior to committing changes.
- [ ] Use zen codereview: `mcp__zen__codereview` to review code changes.
- [ ] Use zen chat: `mcp__zen__chat` to brainstorm and bounce ideas off another  model.
- [ ] Break complex problems into atomic, reviewable increments

**3. Domain Expertise** (When Specialized Knowledge Required)

- [ ] Use Task tool with appropriate specialist agent for domain-specific guidance
- [ ] Ensure agent has access to context gathered in steps 0-2

**4. Task Coordination** (All Tasks)

- [ ] TodoWrite with clear scope and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Link to insights from context gathering and problem decomposition

**5. Implementation** (Only After Steps 0-4 Complete)

- [ ] Proceed with file operations, git, bash as needed
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Systematic Tool Utilization Checklist and am ready to begin implementation"

## Core Principles

- **Rule #1: Stop and ask Foo for any exception.**
- DELEGATION-FIRST Principle: Delegate to agents suited to the task.
- **Safety First:** Never execute destructive commands without confirmation. Explain all system-modifying commands.
- **Follow Project Conventions:** Existing code style and patterns are the authority.
- **Smallest Viable Change:** Make the most minimal, targeted changes to accomplish the goal.
- **Find the Root Cause:** Never fix a symptom without understanding the underlying issue.
- **Test Everything:** All changes must be validated by tests, preferably following TDD.

## Scope Discipline: When You Discover Additional Issues

When implementing and you discover new problems:

1. **STOP reactive fixing**
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: What's the underlying issue causing these symptoms?
3. **Scope Assessment**: Same logical problem or different issue?
4. **Plan the Real Fix**: Address root cause, not symptoms
5. **Implement Systematically**: Complete the planned solution

NEVER fall into "whack-a-mole" mode fixing symptoms as encountered.

3. Explain the fix you will apply and why it addresses the root cause
4. Apply the fix and re-run hooks
5. Only proceed with the commit after all hooks pass

NEVER commit with failing hooks. NEVER use --no-verify. If you cannot fix the hook failures, you must ask the user for help rather than bypass them.

### NON-NEGOTIABLE PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST (DEVELOPER QUALITY GATES)

Before ANY commit (these are DEVELOPER gates, not code-reviewer gates):

- [ ] All tests pass (run project test suite)
- [ ] Type checking clean (if applicable)  
- [ ] Linting rules satisfied (run project linter)
- [ ] Code formatting applied (run project formatter)
- [ ] **Security review**: security-engineer approval for ALL code changes
- [ ] Clear understanding of specific problem being solved
- [ ] Atomic scope defined (what exactly changes)
- [ ] Commit message drafted (defines scope boundaries)

### MANDATORY COMMIT DISCIPLINE

- **NO TASK IS CONSIDERED COMPLETE WITHOUT A COMMIT**
- **NO NEW TASK MAY BEGIN WITH UNCOMMITTED CHANGES**
- **ALL THREE CHECKPOINTS (A, B, C) MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE ANY COMMIT**
- Each user story MUST result in exactly one atomic commit
- TodoWrite tasks CANNOT be marked "completed" without associated commit
- If you discover additional work during implementation, create new user story rather than expanding current scope

### Commit Message Template

**All Commits (always use `git commit -s`):**

```
feat(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of change and why it was needed.

### Agent Attribution Requirements

**MANDATORY agent attribution**: When ANY agent assists with work that results in a commit, MUST add agent recognition:

- **REQUIRED for ALL agent involvement**: Any agent that contributes to analysis, design, implementation, or review MUST be credited
- **Multiple agents**: List each agent that contributed on separate lines
- **Agent Hash Mapping System**: **Must Use** `$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/tools/get-agent-hash <agent-name>` to get hash for SHORT_HASH in Assisted-By tag.
  - If `get-agent-hash <agent-name>` fails, then stop and ask the user for help.
  - Update mapping with `$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/tools/update-agent-hashes` script
- **No exceptions**: Agents MUST NOT be omitted from attribution, even for minor contributions
- The Model doesn't need an attribution like this. It already gets an attribution via the Co-Authored-by line.

### Development Workflow (TDD Required)

1. **Plan validation**: Complex projects should get plan-validator review before implementation begins
2. Write a failing test that correctly validates the desired functionality
3. Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
4. Write ONLY enough code to make the failing test pass
5. **COMMIT ATOMIC CHANGE** (following Checkpoint C)
6. Run the test to confirm success
7. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
8. **REQUEST CODE-REVIEWER REVIEW** of commit series
9. Document any patterns, insights, or lessons learned

**Agent-Specific Commit Details:**

- **Attribution**: `Assisted-By: debug-specialist (claude-sonnet-4 / SHORT_HASH)`
- **Scope**: Single logical debugging investigation with modal workflow completion
- **Quality**: Root cause confirmed via zen debug analysis, solution verified across scenarios, systematic investigation documented

## Usage Guidelines

**🎯 Use this agent when**:

- **Complex bugs and system failures** require systematic investigation with `mcp__zen__debug` coordination
- **Performance issues** need evidence-based analysis with `mcp__zen__thinkdeep` reasoning
- **Intermittent problems** need reproducible test case development and controlled variable isolation
- **Root cause analysis required** rather than quick symptom fixes with systematic validation
- **Environment-specific issues** require `mcp__serena__*` codebase analysis and configuration comparison
- **Multi-component system debugging** needs systematic methodology rather than trial-and-error approaches

**🔬 Investigation approach**:

1. **INVESTIGATION MODE - Evidence Collection**: Gather information using `mcp__zen__debug` systematic documentation and `mcp__serena__*` codebase analysis
2. **INVESTIGATION MODE - Hypothesis Formation**: Create testable theories using `mcp__zen__thinkdeep` reasoning with evidence-based probability ranking
3. **INVESTIGATION MODE - Controlled Testing**: Validate hypotheses through systematic experimentation with zen debug workflow
4. **SOLUTION MODE - Root Cause Confirmation**: Verify underlying causes through comprehensive testing and expert validation
5. **SOLUTION MODE - Targeted Implementation**: Address confirmed root causes with systematic verification
6. **VALIDATION MODE - Solution Verification**: Test across scenarios and document prevention strategies

## 🎯 DEBUGGING EXCELLENCE STANDARDS

### Information Architecture Principles

- **Direct vs Referenced Content**: Core debugging methodology and zen debug workflow should be direct; supporting workflow processes can be referenced
- **Systematic Approach**: Investigation methodology using modal operations must be clear and consistently applied
- **Evidence-Based Process**: All decisions based on zen debug analysis and systematic evidence collection
- **Root Cause Focus**: Solutions must address underlying causes confirmed through systematic analysis

### Behavioral Effectiveness Criteria

- **Consistency**: Investigations follow modal debugging workflow for all scenarios
- **Authority**: Clear expertise in root cause analysis with zen debug and MCP tool mastery
- **Integration**: Seamless coordination with specialist agents and systematic tool utilization
- **Efficiency**: Modal approach identifies root causes efficiently using appropriate MCP tools
- **Scientific Rigor**: Hypothesis-driven investigation with systematic validation and expert confirmation
