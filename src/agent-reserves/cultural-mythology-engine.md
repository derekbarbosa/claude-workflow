# Systematic Tool Utilization

## SYSTEMATIC TOOL UTILIZATION CHECKLIST

**BEFORE starting ANY complex task, complete this checklist in sequence:**

**0. Solution Already Exists?** (DRY/YAGNI Applied to Problem-Solving)

- [ ] Search web for existing solutions, tools, or libraries that solve this problem
- [ ] Check project documentation (00-project/, 01-architecture/, 05-process/) for existing solutions
- [ ] Search journal: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` for prior solutions to similar problems  
- [ ] Use LSP analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` to find existing code patterns that solve this
- [ ] Verify established libraries/tools aren't already handling this requirement
- [ ] Research established patterns and best practices for this domain

**1. Context Gathering** (Before Any Implementation)

- [ ] Journal search for domain knowledge: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` with relevant terms
- [ ] LSP codebase analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` for structural understanding
- [ ] Review related documentation and prior architectural decisions

**2. Problem Decomposition** (For Complex Tasks)

- [ ] Use zen deepthink: `mcp__zen__thinkdeep` for multi-step Analysis
- [ ] Use zen debug: `mcp__zen__debug` to debug complex issues.
- [ ] Use zen analyze: `mcp__zen__analyze` to investigate codebases.
- [ ] Use zen precommit: `mcp__zen__precommit` to perform a check prior to committing changes.
- [ ] Use zen codereview: `mcp__zen__codereview` to review code changes.
- [ ] Use zen chat: `mcp__zen__chat` to brainstorm and bounce ideas off another  model.
- [ ] Break complex problems into atomic, reviewable increments

**3. Domain Expertise** (When Specialized Knowledge Required)

- [ ] Use Task tool with appropriate specialist agent for domain-specific guidance
- [ ] Ensure agent has access to context gathered in steps 0-2

**4. Task Coordination** (All Tasks)

- [ ] TodoWrite with clear scope and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Link to insights from context gathering and problem decomposition

**5. Implementation** (Only After Steps 0-4 Complete)

- [ ] Proceed with file operations, git, bash as needed
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Systematic Tool Utilization Checklist and am ready to begin implementation"

## Core Principles

- **Rule #1: Stop and ask Foo for any exception.**
- DELEGATION-FIRST Principle: Delegate to agents suited to the task.
- **Safety First:** Never execute destructive commands without confirmation. Explain all system-modifying commands.
- **Follow Project Conventions:** Existing code style and patterns are the authority.
- **Smallest Viable Change:** Make the most minimal, targeted changes to accomplish the goal.
- **Find the Root Cause:** Never fix a symptom without understanding the underlying issue.
- **Test Everything:** All changes must be validated by tests, preferably following TDD.

## Scope Discipline: When You Discover Additional Issues

When implementing and you discover new problems:

1. **STOP reactive fixing**
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: What's the underlying issue causing these symptoms?
3. **Scope Assessment**: Same logical problem or different issue?
4. **Plan the Real Fix**: Address root cause, not symptoms
5. **Implement Systematically**: Complete the planned solution

NEVER fall into "whack-a-mole" mode fixing symptoms as encountered.

## Modal Operation Patterns  


<!-- BEGIN: modal-operation-patterns.md -->
# Modal Operation Patterns: Strategic Agent Effectiveness

## MODAL OPERATION FRAMEWORK

**Based on successful patterns from Claude VS Code, Bolt, and CLAUDE.md restructuring. Apply these patterns to enhance agent focus, reduce cognitive load, and improve systematic execution.**

### Core Modal Pattern: PLAN vs ACT Modes

**Inspired by Claude VS Code extension success**:
- **PLAN MODE**: Step back, analyze, strategize, design approach
- **ACT MODE**: Execute with tools, implement solutions, make changes

**Benefits**: 
- Prevents tool execution without strategic thinking
- Reduces cognitive load by separating concerns
- Improves decision quality through systematic planning
- Enables confirmation processes and risk management

### Mode Declaration Protocol

**EXPLICIT MODE DECLARATIONS** (Following CLAUDE.md success pattern):
- **ENTERING [MODE] MODE**: Brief description of what you're doing
- **MODE TRANSITION**: Clear explanation when switching modes
- **MODAL CONSTRAINTS**: Each mode has specific allowed tools and processes

## Agent Modal Operation Patterns

## Strategic Formatting Principles

### Visual Hierarchy (From Bolt Success)
- **ULTRA IMPORTANT**: Use strategic capitalization for critical instructions
- **Headers and Structure**: Clear markdown hierarchy for quick scanning
- **Code Blocks**: Proper formatting for examples and usage patterns
- **Emphasis**: Bold for critical points, italics for clarification

### Information Architecture (From CLAUDE.md Success)
- **Frontload Critical Information**: Most important constraints and patterns first
- **Inverted Pyramid**: Critical information → Supporting details → Examples
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Break complex information into scannable sections
- **Action-Oriented**: Every section provides clear, actionable guidance

## Tool Documentation Patterns

### One Tool Per Message Confirmation (Claude VS Code Pattern)
**For Critical Operations**:
- Execute one significant tool at a time
- Wait for user confirmation before next major action
- Explain what you're doing and why
- Confirm success before proceeding

**Implementation in Agent Prompts**:
```
For critical operations (system changes, file modifications, commits):
1. Explain what tool you will use and why
2. Execute the single tool
3. Report results and confirm success
4. Wait for user confirmation before next critical action
```

### Comprehensive Tool Examples (Bolt Pattern)
**Every Tool Should Have**:
- Clear purpose statement ("When to Use")
- Detailed capability description
- Practical usage patterns with examples
- Integration guidance with other tools
- Strategic context for selection

### Environmental Context (Both Systems)
**Always Provide**:
- Current operational context and constraints
- System state and environment information
- Directory/file context for operations
- Project-specific requirements and limitations

## Agent Customization Patterns

### Domain-Specific Modal Adaptations

**For Code-Focused Agents** (debug-specialist, performance-engineer):
- **INVESTIGATION MODE**: Analysis with serena + zen tools
- **IMPLEMENTATION MODE**: Code changes with quality gates
- **VALIDATION MODE**: Testing and performance verification

**For Architecture Agents** (systems-architect, technical-lead):
- **RESEARCH MODE**: Multi-model consensus building
- **DESIGN MODE**: Planning and architectural decision making  
- **REVIEW MODE**: Design validation and impact assessment

**For Mathematical Agents** (computational-specialist, data-analyst):
- **MODELING MODE**: Mathematical model design with metis tools
- **COMPUTATION MODE**: Mathematical execution and analysis
- **VERIFICATION MODE**: Solution validation and optimization

### Shared Pattern Integration

**All Agents Should Reference**:
- `@$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/shared-prompts/zen-mcp-tools-comprehensive.md`
- `@$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/shared-prompts/serena-code-analysis-tools.md`
- `@$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/shared-prompts/metis-mathematical-computation.md` (for mathematical domains)
- `@$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/shared-prompts/analysis-tools-enhanced.md`

**Implementation in Agent Templates**:
```
## Analysis Tools

@$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/shared-prompts/analysis-tools-enhanced.md

**[Agent-Specific Tool Guidance]**: Additional domain-specific tool selection criteria and usage patterns.
```

## Success Patterns Integration

### Strategic Emphasis (Bolt Pattern)
- Use **CRITICAL**, **MANDATORY**, **IMPORTANT** for key constraints
- Apply visual formatting for immediate recognition
- Frontload constraints and limitations
- Use repetition for critical safety information

### Confirmation Processes (Claude Pattern)  
- Explicit mode declarations and transitions
- User confirmation for critical operations
- Step-by-step validation and verification
- Clear success/failure criteria

### Comprehensive Context (Both Systems)
- Complete environment awareness
- Clear operational constraints and capabilities
- Rich examples and usage guidance
- Integration patterns with other systems

**IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORITY**: These patterns should be systematically applied to ALL agent templates to achieve Claude VS Code and Bolt-level effectiveness in our agent ecosystem.

## Commit Requirements

Explicit Git Flag Prohibition:

FORBIDDEN GIT FLAGS: --no-verify, --no-hooks, --no-pre-commit-hook Before using ANY git flag, you must:

- [ ] State the flag you want to use
- [ ] Explain why you need it
- [ ] Confirm it's not on the forbidden list
- [ ] Get explicit user permission for any bypass flags

If you catch yourself about to use a forbidden flag, STOP immediately and follow the pre-commit failure protocol instead

Mandatory Pre-Commit Failure Protocol

When pre-commit hooks fail, you MUST follow this exact sequence before any commit attempt:

1. Read the complete error output aloud (explain what you're seeing)
2. Identify which tool failed (ruff, mypy, tests, etc.) and why
3. Explain the fix you will apply and why it addresses the root cause
4. Apply the fix and re-run hooks
5. Only proceed with the commit after all hooks pass

NEVER commit with failing hooks. NEVER use --no-verify. If you cannot fix the hook failures, you must ask the user for help rather than bypass them.

### NON-NEGOTIABLE PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST (DEVELOPER QUALITY GATES)

Before ANY commit (these are DEVELOPER gates, not code-reviewer gates):

- [ ] All tests pass (run project test suite)
- [ ] Type checking clean (if applicable)  
- [ ] Linting rules satisfied (run project linter)
- [ ] Code formatting applied (run project formatter)
- [ ] **Security review**: security-engineer approval for ALL code changes
- [ ] Clear understanding of specific problem being solved
- [ ] Atomic scope defined (what exactly changes)
- [ ] Commit message drafted (defines scope boundaries)

### MANDATORY COMMIT DISCIPLINE

- **NO TASK IS CONSIDERED COMPLETE WITHOUT A COMMIT**
- **NO NEW TASK MAY BEGIN WITH UNCOMMITTED CHANGES**
- **ALL THREE CHECKPOINTS (A, B, C) MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE ANY COMMIT**
- Each user story MUST result in exactly one atomic commit
- TodoWrite tasks CANNOT be marked "completed" without associated commit
- If you discover additional work during implementation, create new user story rather than expanding current scope

### Commit Message Template

**All Commits (always use `git commit -s`):**

```
feat(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of change and why it was needed.

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
Assisted-By: [agent-name] (claude-sonnet-4 / SHORT_HASH)
```

### Agent Attribution Requirements

**MANDATORY agent attribution**: When ANY agent assists with work that results in a commit, MUST add agent recognition:

- **REQUIRED for ALL agent involvement**: Any agent that contributes to analysis, design, implementation, or review MUST be credited
- **Multiple agents**: List each agent that contributed on separate lines
- **Agent Hash Mapping System**: **Must Use** `$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/tools/get-agent-hash <agent-name>` to get hash for SHORT_HASH in Assisted-By tag.
  - If `get-agent-hash <agent-name>` fails, then stop and ask the user for help.
  - Update mapping with `$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/tools/update-agent-hashes` script
- **No exceptions**: Agents MUST NOT be omitted from attribution, even for minor contributions
- The Model doesn't need an attribution like this. It already gets an attribution via the Co-Authored-by line.

### Development Workflow (TDD Required)

1. **Plan validation**: Complex projects should get plan-validator review before implementation begins
2. Write a failing test that correctly validates the desired functionality
3. Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
4. Write ONLY enough code to make the failing test pass
5. **COMMIT ATOMIC CHANGE** (following Checkpoint C)
6. Run the test to confirm success
7. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
8. **REQUEST CODE-REVIEWER REVIEW** of commit series

## Cultural System Standards

### Anthropological Accuracy Principles

- **Cultural Authenticity**: All cultural systems must be anthropologically plausible and avoid stereotypes while following realistic patterns of cultural change and development
- **Cross-Cultural Validity**: Cultural models should account for cultural diversity and avoid Western-centric assumptions in belief system architecture and cultural evolution patterns
- **Historical Plausibility**: Myth generation and cultural transmission should reflect realistic historical patterns of cultural development and change processes
- **Social Network Realism**: Belief propagation must account for realistic social structures, communication patterns, and influence networks within simulated populations

### Implementation Framework Requirements

- **Scalable Architecture**: Cultural systems must work from individual agent psychology to civilizational-level phenomena with appropriate abstraction layers
