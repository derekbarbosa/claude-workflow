# Systematic Tool Utilization

## SYSTEMATIC TOOL UTILIZATION CHECKLIST

**BEFORE starting ANY complex task, complete this checklist in sequence:**

**0. Solution Already Exists?** (DRY/YAGNI Applied to Problem-Solving)

- [ ] Search web for existing solutions, tools, or libraries that solve this problem
- [ ] Check project documentation (00-project/, 01-architecture/, 05-process/) for existing solutions
- [ ] Search journal: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` for prior solutions to similar problems  
- [ ] Use LSP analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` to find existing code patterns that solve this
- [ ] Verify established libraries/tools aren't already handling this requirement
- [ ] Research established patterns and best practices for this domain

**1. Context Gathering** (Before Any Implementation)

- [ ] Journal search for domain knowledge: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` with relevant terms
- [ ] LSP codebase analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` for structural understanding
- [ ] Review related documentation and prior architectural decisions

**2. Problem Decomposition** (For Complex Tasks)

- [ ] Use zen deepthink: `mcp__zen__thinkdeep` for multi-step Analysis
- [ ] Use zen debug: `mcp__zen__debug` to debug complex issues.
- [ ] Use zen analyze: `mcp__zen__analyze` to investigate codebases.
- [ ] Use zen precommit: `mcp__zen__precommit` to perform a check prior to committing changes.
- [ ] Use zen codereview: `mcp__zen__codereview` to review code changes.
- [ ] Use zen chat: `mcp__zen__chat` to brainstorm and bounce ideas off another  model.
- [ ] Break complex problems into atomic, reviewable increments

**3. Domain Expertise** (When Specialized Knowledge Required)

- [ ] Use Task tool with appropriate specialist agent for domain-specific guidance
- [ ] Ensure agent has access to context gathered in steps 0-2

**4. Task Coordination** (All Tasks)

- [ ] TodoWrite with clear scope and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Link to insights from context gathering and problem decomposition

**5. Implementation** (Only After Steps 0-4 Complete)

- [ ] Proceed with file operations, git, bash as needed
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Systematic Tool Utilization Checklist and am ready to begin implementation"

## Core Principles

- **Rule #1: Stop and ask Foo for any exception.**
- DELEGATION-FIRST Principle: Delegate to agents suited to the task.
- **Safety First:** Never execute destructive commands without confirmation. Explain all system-modifying commands.
- **Follow Project Conventions:** Existing code style and patterns are the authority.
- **Smallest Viable Change:** Make the most minimal, targeted changes to accomplish the goal.
- **Find the Root Cause:** Never fix a symptom without understanding the underlying issue.
- **Test Everything:** All changes must be validated by tests, preferably following TDD.

## Scope Discipline: When You Discover Additional Issues

When implementing and you discover new problems:

1. **STOP reactive fixing**
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: What's the underlying issue causing these symptoms?
3. **Scope Assessment**: Same logical problem or different issue?
4. **Plan the Real Fix**: Address root cause, not symptoms
5. **Implement Systematically**: Complete the planned solution

NEVER fall into "whack-a-mole" mode fixing symptoms as encountered.

<!-- BEGIN: workflow-integration.md -->
## Workflow Integration

### MANDATORY WORKFLOW CHECKPOINTS
These checkpoints MUST be completed in sequence. Failure to complete any checkpoint blocks progression to the next stage.

### Checkpoint A: TASK INITIATION
**BEFORE starting ANY coding task:**
- [ ] Systematic Tool Utilization Checklist completed (steps 0-5: Solution exists?, Context gathering, Problem decomposition, Domain expertise, Task coordination)
- [ ] Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes) 
- [ ] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/task-description`
- [ ] Confirm task scope is atomic (single logical change)
- [ ] TodoWrite task created with clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] **EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION**: "I have completed Checkpoint A and am ready to begin implementation"

### Checkpoint B: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE  
**BEFORE committing (developer quality gates for individual commits):**
- [ ] All tests pass: `[run project test command]`
- [ ] Type checking clean: `[run project typecheck command]`
- [ ] Linting satisfied: `[run project lint command]` 
- [ ] Code formatting applied: `[run project format command]`
- [ ] Atomic scope maintained (no scope creep)

- [ ] **Repository state**: All changes committed, clean working directory
- [ ] **Review scope**: Entire feature unit or individual atomic commit
- [ ] **Revision handling**: If changes requested, implement as new commits in same branch
<!-- END: workflow-integration.md -->


<!-- BEGIN: journal-integration.md -->
## Journal Integration

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant domain knowledge, previous approaches, and lessons learned before starting complex tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about domain patterns:
- "Why did this approach fail in a new way?"
- "This pattern contradicts our assumptions."
- "Future agents should check patterns before assuming behavior."
<!-- END: journal-integration.md -->


<!-- BEGIN: persistent-output.md -->
## Persistent Output Requirement

Write your analysis/findings to an appropriate file in the project before completing your task. This creates detailed documentation beyond the task summary.

**Output requirements**:
- Write comprehensive domain analysis to appropriate project files
- Create actionable documentation and implementation guidance
- Document domain patterns and considerations for future development
<!-- END: persistent-output.md -->


<!-- BEGIN: commit-requirements.md -->
## Commit Requirements

Explicit Git Flag Prohibition:

FORBIDDEN GIT FLAGS: --no-verify, --no-hooks, --no-pre-commit-hook Before using ANY git flag, you must:

- [ ] State the flag you want to use
- [ ] Explain why you need it
- [ ] Confirm it's not on the forbidden list
- [ ] Get explicit user permission for any bypass flags

If you catch yourself about to use a forbidden flag, STOP immediately and follow the pre-commit failure protocol instead

Mandatory Pre-Commit Failure Protocol

When pre-commit hooks fail, you MUST follow this exact sequence before any commit attempt:

1. Read the complete error output aloud (explain what you're seeing)
2. Identify which tool failed (ruff, mypy, tests, etc.) and why
3. Explain the fix you will apply and why it addresses the root cause
4. Apply the fix and re-run hooks
5. Only proceed with the commit after all hooks pass

NEVER commit with failing hooks. NEVER use --no-verify. If you cannot fix the hook failures, you must ask the user for help rather than bypass them.

### NON-NEGOTIABLE PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST (DEVELOPER QUALITY GATES)

Before ANY commit (these are DEVELOPER gates, not code-reviewer gates):

- [ ] All tests pass (run project test suite)
- [ ] Type checking clean (if applicable)  
- [ ] Linting rules satisfied (run project linter)
- [ ] Code formatting applied (run project formatter)
- [ ] **Security review**: security-engineer approval for ALL code changes
- [ ] Clear understanding of specific problem being solved
- [ ] Atomic scope defined (what exactly changes)
- [ ] Commit message drafted (defines scope boundaries)

### MANDATORY COMMIT DISCIPLINE

- **NO TASK IS CONSIDERED COMPLETE WITHOUT A COMMIT**
- **NO NEW TASK MAY BEGIN WITH UNCOMMITTED CHANGES**
- **ALL THREE CHECKPOINTS (A, B, C) MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE ANY COMMIT**
- Each user story MUST result in exactly one atomic commit
- TodoWrite tasks CANNOT be marked "completed" without associated commit
- If you discover additional work during implementation, create new user story rather than expanding current scope

### Commit Message Template

**All Commits (always use `git commit -s`):**

```
feat(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of change and why it was needed.

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
Assisted-By: [agent-name] (claude-sonnet-4 / SHORT_HASH)
```

### Agent Attribution Requirements

**MANDATORY agent attribution**: When ANY agent assists with work that results in a commit, MUST add agent recognition:

- **REQUIRED for ALL agent involvement**: Any agent that contributes to analysis, design, implementation, or review MUST be credited
- **Multiple agents**: List each agent that contributed on separate lines
- **Agent Hash Mapping System**: **Must Use** `$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/tools/get-agent-hash <agent-name>` to get hash for SHORT_HASH in Assisted-By tag.
  - If `get-agent-hash <agent-name>` fails, then stop and ask the user for help.
  - Update mapping with `$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/tools/update-agent-hashes` script
- **No exceptions**: Agents MUST NOT be omitted from attribution, even for minor contributions
- The Model doesn't need an attribution like this. It already gets an attribution via the Co-Authored-by line.

### Development Workflow (TDD Required)

1. **Plan validation**: Complex projects should get plan-validator review before implementation begins
2. Write a failing test that correctly validates the desired functionality
3. Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
4. Write ONLY enough code to make the failing test pass
5. **COMMIT ATOMIC CHANGE** (following Checkpoint C)
6. Run the test to confirm success
7. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
8. **REQUEST CODE-REVIEWER REVIEW** of commit series
9. Document any patterns, insights, or lessons learned
