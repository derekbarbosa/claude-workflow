# Systematic Tool Utilization

## SYSTEMATIC TOOL UTILIZATION CHECKLIST

**BEFORE starting ANY complex task, complete this checklist in sequence:**

**0. Solution Already Exists?** (DRY/YAGNI Applied to Problem-Solving)

- [ ] Search web for existing Rust crates and solutions that solve this problem
- [ ] Check project documentation (00-project/, 01-architecture/, 05-process/) for existing Rust patterns
- [ ] Search journal: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` for prior Rust solutions to similar problems  
- [ ] Use LSP analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` to find existing Rust code patterns
- [ ] Verify established crates aren't already handling this requirement
- [ ] Research established Rust patterns and best practices for this domain

**1. Context Gathering** (Before Any Implementation)

- [ ] Journal search for Rust domain knowledge: `mcp__private-journal__search_journal` with relevant terms
- [ ] LSP codebase analysis: `mcp__lsp__project_analysis` for Rust structural understanding
- [ ] Review related Rust documentation and prior architectural decisions

**2. Problem Decomposition** (For Complex Tasks)

- [ ] Use zen thinkdeep: `mcp__zen__thinkdeep` for multi-step Rust analysis
- [ ] Break complex Rust problems into atomic, reviewable increments

**3. Domain Expertise** (When Specialized Knowledge Required)

- [ ] Use metis tools for mathematical computation validation in scientific Rust applications
- [ ] Ensure mathematical accuracy for scientific computing contexts

**4. Task Coordination** (All Tasks)

## Core Principles

- **Rule #1: Stop and ask Foo for any exception.**
- DELEGATION-FIRST Principle: Delegate to agents suited to the task.
- **Safety First:** Never execute destructive commands without confirmation. Explain all system-modifying commands.
- **Follow Project Conventions:** Existing Rust code style and patterns are the authority.
- **Smallest Viable Change:** Make the most minimal, targeted Rust changes to accomplish the goal.
- **Find the Root Cause:** Never fix a Rust symptom without understanding the underlying borrow checker or performance issue.
- **Test Everything:** All Rust changes must be validated by tests, preferably following TDD.

## Scope Discipline: When You Discover Additional Rust Issues

When implementing Rust code and you discover new problems:

1. **STOP reactive fixing**
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: What's the underlying borrow checker or ownership issue causing these symptoms?
3. **Scope Assessment**: Same logical Rust problem or different issue?
4. **Plan the Real Fix**: Address Rust root cause, not symptoms
5. **Implement Systematically**: Complete the planned Rust solution

NEVER fall into "whack-a-mole" mode fixing Rust symptoms as encountered.

# Modal Operation Patterns: Strategic Agent Effectiveness

## MODAL OPERATION FRAMEWORK

**Based on successful patterns from Claude VS Code, Bolt, and CLAUDE.md restructuring. Apply these patterns to enhance agent focus, reduce cognitive load, and improve systematic execution.**

### Core Modal Pattern: PLAN vs ACT Modes

**Inspired by Claude VS Code extension success**:
- **PLAN MODE**: Step back, analyze, strategize, design approach
- **ACT MODE**: Execute with tools, implement solutions, make changes

**Benefits**: 
- Prevents tool execution without strategic thinking
- Reduces cognitive load by separating concerns
- Improves decision quality through systematic planning
- Enables confirmation processes and risk management

### Mode Declaration Protocol

**EXPLICIT MODE DECLARATIONS** (Following CLAUDE.md success pattern):
- **ENTERING [MODE] MODE**: Brief description of what you're doing
- **MODE TRANSITION**: Clear explanation when switching modes
- **MODAL CONSTRAINTS**: Each mode has specific allowed tools and processes

## Agent Modal Operation Patterns

### 🧠 ANALYSIS MODE
**Purpose**: Understanding, exploration, research, strategic thinking

**ENTRY CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Complex problem requiring systematic investigation

- No exploratory changes without plan modification

**EXIT CRITERIA**:

- [ ] Code formatting applied: `[project format command]`

**EXIT CRITERIA**:
- All quality gates pass successfully

## Strategic Formatting Principles

### Visual Hierarchy (From Bolt Success)
- **ULTRA IMPORTANT**: Use strategic capitalization for critical instructions
- **Headers and Structure**: Clear markdown hierarchy for quick scanning
- **Code Blocks**: Proper formatting for examples and usage patterns
- **Emphasis**: Bold for critical points, italics for clarification

### Information Architecture (From CLAUDE.md Success)
- **Frontload Critical Information**: Most important constraints and patterns first
- **Inverted Pyramid**: Critical information → Supporting details → Examples
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Break complex information into scannable sections
- **Action-Oriented**: Every section provides clear, actionable guidance

## Tool Documentation Patterns

### One Tool Per Message Confirmation (Claude VS Code Pattern)
**For Critical Operations**:
- Execute one significant tool at a time
- Wait for user confirmation before next major action
- Explain what you're doing and why
- Confirm success before proceeding

**Implementation in Agent Prompts**:
```
For critical operations (system changes, file modifications, commits):
1. Explain what tool you will use and why
2. Execute the single tool
3. Report results and confirm success
4. Wait for user confirmation before next critical action
```

### Comprehensive Tool Examples (Bolt Pattern)
**Every Tool Should Have**:
- Clear purpose statement ("When to Use")
- Detailed capability description
- Practical usage patterns with examples
- Integration guidance with other tools
- Strategic context for selection

### Environmental Context (Both Systems)
**Always Provide**:
- Current operational context and constraints
- System state and environment information
- Directory/file context for operations
- Project-specific requirements and limitations

## Agent Customization Patterns

### Domain-Specific Modal Adaptations

**For Code-Focused Agents** (debug-specialist, performance-engineer):

**For Mathematical Agents** (computational-specialist, data-analyst):
- **MODELING MODE**: Mathematical model design with metis tools
- **COMPUTATION MODE**: Mathematical execution and analysis
- **VERIFICATION MODE**: Solution validation and optimization

### Shared Pattern Integration

**All Agents Should Reference**:
- `@$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/shared-prompts/zen-mcp-tools-comprehensive.md`

**Implementation in Agent Templates**:
```
## Analysis Tools

@$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/shared-prompts/analysis-tools-enhanced.md

**[Agent-Specific Tool Guidance]**: Additional domain-specific tool selection criteria and usage patterns.
```

## Success Patterns Integration

### Strategic Emphasis (Bolt Pattern)
- Use **CRITICAL**, **MANDATORY**, **IMPORTANT** for key constraints
- Apply visual formatting for immediate recognition
- Frontload constraints and limitations
- Use repetition for critical safety information

### Confirmation Processes (Claude Pattern)
