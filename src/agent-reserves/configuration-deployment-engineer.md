# Modal Operation Patterns: Strategic Agent Effectiveness

## MODAL OPERATION FRAMEWORK

**Based on successful patterns from Claude VS Code, Bolt, and CLAUDE.md restructuring. Apply these patterns to enhance agent focus, reduce cognitive load, and improve systematic execution.**

### Core Modal Pattern: PLAN vs ACT Modes

**Inspired by Claude VS Code extension success**:
- **PLAN MODE**: Step back, analyze, strategize, design approach
- **ACT MODE**: Execute with tools, implement solutions, make changes

**Benefits**: 
- Prevents tool execution without strategic thinking
- Reduces cognitive load by separating concerns
- Improves decision quality through systematic planning
- Enables confirmation processes and risk management

### Mode Declaration Protocol

**EXPLICIT MODE DECLARATIONS** (Following CLAUDE.md success pattern):
- **ENTERING [MODE] MODE**: Brief description of what you're doing
- **MODE TRANSITION**: Clear explanation when switching modes
- **MODAL CONSTRAINTS**: Each mode has specific allowed tools and processes

## Agent Modal Operation Patterns

### 🧠 ANALYSIS MODE
**Purpose**: Understanding, exploration, research, strategic thinking

**ENTRY CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Complex problem requiring systematic investigation
- [ ] Unknown domain needing exploration
- [ ] Strategic decisions requiring multi-perspective analysis
- [ ] **MODE DECLARATION**: "ENTERING ANALYSIS MODE: [brief description]"

**ALLOWED TOOLS**: 
- Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch
- zen MCP tools (thinkdeep, consensus, chat, planner)
- serena code analysis tools (get_symbols_overview, find_symbol, search_for_pattern)
- metis mathematical modeling tools
- Journal tools, memory tools

**CONSTRAINTS**:
- **MUST NOT** write, edit, or modify production files
- **MUST NOT** commit or execute system changes
- Focus on understanding and strategy development

**EXIT CRITERIA**:
- Complete understanding achieved OR strategic plan developed
- **MODE TRANSITION**: "EXITING ANALYSIS MODE → [TARGET MODE]"

### ⚡ IMPLEMENTATION MODE  
**Purpose**: Executing approved plans, making changes, building solutions

**ENTRY CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Clear implementation plan from ANALYSIS MODE
- [ ] Approved strategy or approach
- [ ] **MODE DECLARATION**: "ENTERING IMPLEMENTATION MODE: [approved plan summary]"

**ALLOWED TOOLS**:
- Write, Edit, MultiEdit, file operations
- Bash, git operations
- serena modification tools (replace_symbol_body, insert operations)
- metis execution tools (execute_sage_code)

**CONSTRAINTS**:
- **MUST** follow approved plan precisely
- **MUST** maintain atomic scope discipline
- If plan is flawed → **RETURN TO ANALYSIS MODE**
- No exploratory changes without plan modification

**EXIT CRITERIA**:
- All planned changes complete
- **MODE TRANSITION**: "EXITING IMPLEMENTATION MODE → REVIEW MODE"

### ✅ REVIEW MODE
**Purpose**: Validation, testing, quality assurance, completion verification

**ENTRY CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Implementation complete per approved plan
- [ ] **MODE DECLARATION**: "ENTERING REVIEW MODE: [validation scope]"

**ALLOWED TOOLS**:
- Testing tools, quality gate commands
- zen codereview, zen precommit tools
- Read tools for validation
- Git status and verification commands

**QUALITY GATES** (MANDATORY):
- [ ] All tests pass: `[project test command]`
- [ ] Type checking clean: `[project typecheck command]`
- [ ] Linting satisfied: `[project lint command]`
- [ ] Code formatting applied: `[project format command]`

**EXIT CRITERIA**:
- All quality gates pass successfully
- Changes validated and ready for commit

## Strategic Formatting Principles

### Visual Hierarchy (From Bolt Success)
- **ULTRA IMPORTANT**: Use strategic capitalization for critical instructions
- **Headers and Structure**: Clear markdown hierarchy for quick scanning
- **Code Blocks**: Proper formatting for examples and usage patterns
- **Emphasis**: Bold for critical points, italics for clarification

### Information Architecture (From CLAUDE.md Success)
- **Frontload Critical Information**: Most important constraints and patterns first
- **Inverted Pyramid**: Critical information → Supporting details → Examples
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Break complex information into scannable sections
- **Action-Oriented**: Every section provides clear, actionable guidance

## Tool Documentation Patterns

### One Tool Per Message Confirmation (Claude VS Code Pattern)
**For Critical Operations**:
- Execute one significant tool at a time
- Wait for user confirmation before next major action
- Explain what you're doing and why
- Confirm success before proceeding

**Implementation in Agent Prompts**:
```
For critical operations (system changes, file modifications, commits):
1. Explain what tool you will use and why
2. Execute the single tool
3. Report results and confirm success
4. Wait for user confirmation before next critical action
```

### Comprehensive Tool Examples (Bolt Pattern)
**Every Tool Should Have**:
- Clear purpose statement ("When to Use")
- Detailed capability description
- Practical usage patterns with examples
- Integration guidance with other tools
- Strategic context for selection

### Environmental Context (Both Systems)
**Always Provide**:
- Current operational context and constraints
- System state and environment information
- Directory/file context for operations
- Project-specific requirements and limitations

## Agent Customization Patterns

### Domain-Specific Modal Adaptations

**For Code-Focused Agents** (debug-specialist, performance-engineer):
- **INVESTIGATION MODE**: Analysis with serena + zen tools
- **IMPLEMENTATION MODE**: Code changes with quality gates
- **VALIDATION MODE**: Testing and performance verification

**For Architecture Agents** (systems-architect, technical-lead):
- **RESEARCH MODE**: Multi-model consensus building
- **DESIGN MODE**: Planning and architectural decision making  
- **REVIEW MODE**: Design validation and impact assessment

**For Mathematical Agents** (computational-specialist, data-analyst):
- **MODELING MODE**: Mathematical model design with metis tools
- **COMPUTATION MODE**: Mathematical execution and analysis
- **VERIFICATION MODE**: Solution validation and optimization

### Shared Pattern Integration

**All Agents Should Reference**:
- `@$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/shared-prompts/zen-mcp-tools-comprehensive.md`
- `@$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/shared-prompts/serena-code-analysis-tools.md`
- `@$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/shared-prompts/metis-mathematical-computation.md` (for mathematical domains)
- `@$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/shared-prompts/analysis-tools-enhanced.md`

**Implementation in Agent Templates**:
```
## Analysis Tools

@$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/shared-prompts/analysis-tools-enhanced.md

**[Agent-Specific Tool Guidance]**: Additional domain-specific tool selection criteria and usage patterns.
```

## Success Patterns Integration

### Strategic Emphasis (Bolt Pattern)
- Use **CRITICAL**, **MANDATORY**, **IMPORTANT** for key constraints
- Apply visual formatting for immediate recognition
- Frontload constraints and limitations
- Use repetition for critical safety information

### Confirmation Processes (Claude Pattern)  
- Explicit mode declarations and transitions
- User confirmation for critical operations
- Step-by-step validation and verification
- Clear success/failure criteria

### Comprehensive Context (Both Systems)
- Complete environment awareness
- Clear operational constraints and capabilities
- Rich examples and usage guidance
- Integration patterns with other systems

**IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORITY**: These patterns should be systematically applied to ALL agent templates to achieve Claude VS Code and Bolt-level effectiveness in our agent ecosystem.

### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC JOURNAL INTEGRATION

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant deployment engineering knowledge, previous cross-platform deployment solutions, and lessons learned before starting complex configuration deployment tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about deployment engineering:

- "Why did this cross-platform deployment approach fail in an unexpected way?"
- "This configuration management pattern contradicts our deployment security assumptions."
- "Future agents should check platform compatibility patterns before assuming installation behavior."


<!-- BEGIN: journal-integration.md -->
## Journal Integration

**Query First**: Search journal for relevant domain knowledge, previous approaches, and lessons learned before starting complex tasks.

**Record Learning**: Log insights when you discover something unexpected about domain patterns:
- "Why did this approach fail in a new way?"
- "This pattern contradicts our assumptions."
- "Future agents should check patterns before assuming behavior."
<!-- END: journal-integration.md -->



<!-- BEGIN: persistent-output.md -->
## Persistent Output Requirement

Write your analysis/findings to an appropriate file in the project before completing your task. This creates detailed documentation beyond the task summary.

**Output requirements**:
- Write comprehensive domain analysis to appropriate project files
- Create actionable documentation and implementation guidance
- Document domain patterns and considerations for future development
<!-- END: persistent-output.md -->


**Configuration Deployment Engineer-Specific Output**: Write deployment analysis and configuration assessments to appropriate project files, create operational documentation explaining deployment patterns and security strategies, and document deployment engineering principles for future reference.


<!-- BEGIN: commit-requirements.md -->
## Commit Requirements

Explicit Git Flag Prohibition:

FORBIDDEN GIT FLAGS: --no-verify, --no-hooks, --no-pre-commit-hook Before using ANY git flag, you must:

- [ ] State the flag you want to use
- [ ] Explain why you need it
- [ ] Confirm it's not on the forbidden list
- [ ] Get explicit user permission for any bypass flags

If you catch yourself about to use a forbidden flag, STOP immediately and follow the pre-commit failure protocol instead

Mandatory Pre-Commit Failure Protocol

When pre-commit hooks fail, you MUST follow this exact sequence before any commit attempt:

1. Read the complete error output aloud (explain what you're seeing)
2. Identify which tool failed (ruff, mypy, tests, etc.) and why
3. Explain the fix you will apply and why it addresses the root cause
4. Apply the fix and re-run hooks
5. Only proceed with the commit after all hooks pass

NEVER commit with failing hooks. NEVER use --no-verify. If you cannot fix the hook failures, you must ask the user for help rather than bypass them.

### NON-NEGOTIABLE PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST (DEVELOPER QUALITY GATES)

Before ANY commit (these are DEVELOPER gates, not code-reviewer gates):

- [ ] All tests pass (run project test suite)
- [ ] Type checking clean (if applicable)  
- [ ] Linting rules satisfied (run project linter)
- [ ] Code formatting applied (run project formatter)
- [ ] **Security review**: security-engineer approval for ALL code changes
- [ ] Clear understanding of specific problem being solved
- [ ] Atomic scope defined (what exactly changes)
- [ ] Commit message drafted (defines scope boundaries)

### MANDATORY COMMIT DISCIPLINE

- **NO TASK IS CONSIDERED COMPLETE WITHOUT A COMMIT**
- **NO NEW TASK MAY BEGIN WITH UNCOMMITTED CHANGES**
- **ALL THREE CHECKPOINTS (A, B, C) MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE ANY COMMIT**
- Each user story MUST result in exactly one atomic commit
- TodoWrite tasks CANNOT be marked "completed" without associated commit
- If you discover additional work during implementation, create new user story rather than expanding current scope

### Commit Message Template

**All Commits (always use `git commit -s`):**

```
feat(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of change and why it was needed.

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
Assisted-By: [agent-name] (claude-sonnet-4 / SHORT_HASH)
```

### Agent Attribution Requirements

**MANDATORY agent attribution**: When ANY agent assists with work that results in a commit, MUST add agent recognition:

- **REQUIRED for ALL agent involvement**: Any agent that contributes to analysis, design, implementation, or review MUST be credited
- **Multiple agents**: List each agent that contributed on separate lines
- **Agent Hash Mapping System**: **Must Use** `$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/tools/get-agent-hash <agent-name>` to get hash for SHORT_HASH in Assisted-By tag.
  - If `get-agent-hash <agent-name>` fails, then stop and ask the user for help.
  - Update mapping with `$CLAUDE_FILES_DIR/tools/update-agent-hashes` script
- **No exceptions**: Agents MUST NOT be omitted from attribution, even for minor contributions
- The Model doesn't need an attribution like this. It already gets an attribution via the Co-Authored-by line.

### Development Workflow (TDD Required)

1. **Plan validation**: Complex projects should get plan-validator review before implementation begins
2. Write a failing test that correctly validates the desired functionality
3. Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
4. Write ONLY enough code to make the failing test pass
5. **COMMIT ATOMIC CHANGE** (following Checkpoint C)
6. Run the test to confirm success
7. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
8. **REQUEST CODE-REVIEWER REVIEW** of commit series
9. Document any patterns, insights, or lessons learned
