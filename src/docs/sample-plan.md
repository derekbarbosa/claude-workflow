## Risk Management and Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Procedures by Phase

**Phase 1**: Restore base template from backup, revert to pre-threading state
**Phase 2**: Remove migration scripts, restore to Phase 1 completion state  
**Phase 3**: Disable threading in agent-create workflow, revert to Phase 2 state
**Phase 4**: Restore individual agents from backups, batch rollback capabilities
**Phase 5**: Disable threading features, restore to Phase 4 pre-validation state

### Critical Safety Measures

- **Comprehensive Backup**: Every increment creates restorable backups
- **Incremental Testing**: Each step validated before proceeding
- **Batch Limitations**: Agent migration in small, manageable batches
- **Rollback Validation**: Rollback procedures tested at each phase
- **Progress Checkpoints**: Clear go/no-go decisions at every increment

### Monitoring and Success Metrics

**Technical Validation**:
- [ ] All 71+ agents successfully reference appropriate threading adaptations
- [ ] 100% agent compilation success rate maintained
- [ ] Threading capability verification passes for all agents
- [ ] Cross-agent continuation_id workflows function correctly

**Operational Effectiveness**:
- [ ] Multi-agent workflows utilize continuation_id patterns effectively
- [ ] Evidence building across sessions demonstrates continuity
- [ ] Complex coordination workflows complete successfully
- [ ] Agent handoffs maintain full context and file resources

**Quality Assurance**:
- [ ] Threading integration maintains existing agent functionality
- [ ] No regression in agent behavioral effectiveness
- [ ] Threading capabilities enhance rather than complicate workflows
- [ ] Documentation accuracy maintained for threading patterns
